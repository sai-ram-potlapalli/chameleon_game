### 🦎 The Chameleon

A digital implementation of the popular social deduction party game "The Chameleon" for iOS devices.

## 📖 About The Game

The Chameleon is a social deduction game where players try to identify who among them is the Chameleon - the one player who doesn't know the secret topic. Players give clues, discuss, and vote to catch the Chameleon before they blend in too well!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Setup**: 3-8 players gather around one device
2. **Topic Card**: A card with 16 topics is displayed to everyone
3. **Secret Topic**: Dice are rolled to determine the secret topic (only known to non-Chameleon players)
4. **Give Clues**: Each player says one word related to the topic
5. **Vote**: Players discuss and vote on who they think is the Chameleon
6. **Reveal**: The suspected player reveals their card
   - If it's the Chameleon, they get one chance to guess the secret topic
   - If they guess wrong, other players win!
   - If a regular player is revealed, the Chameleon wins!
